| OpenWebRX | Accessible, browser-based radio receiver. | https://openwebrx-sdr.andrelom.com |
| Glances   | Real-time system monitoring.              | https://glances-sdr.andrelom.com   |

## Getting Started

First, make a copy of the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`. Update the values inside if needed.

```sh
cp .env.template .env
```

After the update, modify the newly created `.env` file by adjusting the environment variable values accordingly.

### Docker

Then, start the project using the commands below.

```sh
# Start the project.
docker compose up -d;
```

#### Optional

To stop the Docker containers, just run the following command.

```sh
# Stops any previous run.
docker compose down;

# Optional: Prune all unused resources from the system.
docker system prune -af; docker volume prune -af; docker network prune -f;
```
